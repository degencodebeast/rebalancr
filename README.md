> AI-powered portfolio rebalancing protocol built natively for Monad

## 🎯 Problem Statement

DeFi portfolio management suffers from three critical inefficiencies:
- High slippage in large trades due to fragmented liquidity
- Missed opportunities from slow execution on congested chains
- Poor timing from manual management and simplistic rebalancing triggers

## 💡 Solution

Rebalancr solves these challenges through three innovative components:

1. **Data-Driven Intelligence Engine**
   - Statistical market analysis for optimal trade timing
   - Real-time volatility and correlation tracking
   - Risk-adjusted portfolio optimization

2. **Advanced Strategy Engine**
   - Dynamic rebalancing with circuit breakers
   - Risk-aware trade execution
   - Performance tracking and optimization

3. **Kuru DEX Integration**
   - Orderbook-based execution for better pricing
   - Sub-second finality on Monad
   - MEV-protected trading

## 🔧 Core Components

### Intelligence Engine
```python
class IntelligenceEngine:
    """Combines market analysis, Allora predictions, and statistical metrics"""
    
    async def analyze_portfolio(self, user_id: str, portfolio_id: int):
        # Get portfolio data and market analysis
        # Calculate combined scores using asset-specific weights
        # Generate rebalancing recommendations
```

### Strategy Engine
```python
class StrategyEngine:
    """Implements portfolio rebalancing and risk management"""
    
    async def execute_rebalance(self, user_id: str, portfolio_id: int):
        # Calculate asset metrics
        # Check circuit breakers
        # Execute trades with risk management
        # Track performance
```

### Risk Management
```python
class RiskManager:
    """Manages portfolio risk based on statistical metrics"""
    
    async def assess_portfolio_risk(self, portfolio_id: int):
        # Calculate concentration risk
        # Assess volatility exposure
        # Monitor correlation risk
        # Generate risk score
```
